Assignment name: cpp_module_00
Expected files: Warlock.cpp, Warlock.hpp

Create a class Warlock in canonical (Coplien) form.

Private attributes:
- name (string)
- title (string)

Getters (callable on const Warlock):
- const std::string& getName() const;
- const std::string& getTitle() const;

Setter:
- void setTitle(const std::string&);

Constructor:
- Must take name and title (in that order).
- No default constructor.
- No copy constructor or copy assignment.

Examples:
Warlock bob;                            // Does NOT compile
Warlock bob("Bob", "the magnificent");  // Compiles
Warlock jim("Jim", "the nauseating");   // Compiles
bob = jim;                              // Does NOT compile
Warlock jack(jim);                      // Does NOT compile

On construction:
<NAME>: This looks like another boring day.

On destruction:
<NAME>: My job here is done!

Method:
void introduce() const;
// Output: <NAME>: I am <NAME>, <TITLE>!

Example main():
int main() {
  Warlock const richard("Richard", "Mistress of Magma");
  richard.introduce();
  std::cout << richard.getName() << " - " << richard.getTitle() << std::endl;

  Warlock* jack = new Warlock("Jack", "the Long");
  jack->introduce();
  jack->setTitle("the Mighty");
  jack->introduce();

  delete jack;
  return 0;
}

Expected output:
Richard: This looks like another boring day.
Richard: I am Richard, Mistress of Magma!
Richard - Mistress of Magma
Jack: This looks like another boring day.
Jack: I am Jack, the Long!
Jack: I am Jack, the Mighty!
Jack: My job here is done!
Richard: My job here is done!
